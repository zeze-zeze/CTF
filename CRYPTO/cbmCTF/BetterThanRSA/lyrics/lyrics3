For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters
I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it then caught my rage, like
How could I not protect her from this awful phase
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like
A princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster can't be mad, I'll love him
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail dead that
Wait till he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You 17, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest
Father figure but she rocking with it
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said "Nas go and get ya kid"
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon post no pic
Of herself under dressed, no inappropriate shit, right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagrammed it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Shoulda drove on time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast, one day she's ya little princess
Next day she talking boy business, what is this
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God gets us back, he makes us have precious little girls
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
For my brothers with daughters, I call this
Not sayin' that our sons are less important
And I ain't tryna mess ya thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons
How fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off
Cause we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love
